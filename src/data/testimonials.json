First I was using my Claude Max sub and I used all of my limit quickly, so today I had my clawd bot setup a proxy to route my CoPilot subscription as a API endpoint so now it runs on that. It's the fact that clawd can just keep building upon itself just by talking to it in discord is crazy. The future is already here",
