I even gave them names and different characters:\n- Milo (leader - confident and charismatic),\n- Josh (business guy - pragmatic and straight to the point, numbers-driven),\n- Angela (marketing - extroverted, funny and full of ideas),\n- Bob (coding - introverted analytical genius).\n\nI'm still setting up all the skills, but so far it really works great and it's a first use case that's so beneficial to me and can help me in my daily work.",
